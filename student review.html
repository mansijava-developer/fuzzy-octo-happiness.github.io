        <h3>Gowtham GM</h3>
A warm thanks to the Tap Academy team.
I am Gowtham GM from Tamilnadu, a 2024 passed-out student. 
I joined Tap Academy as a CSR student in the month of February. 
My journey with Tap Academy is quite different. The trainers at Tap Academy 
are skilled and experienced. They teach a lot of new concepts and help in 
learning programming languages from scratch.
I am from the Computer Science branch, but the teaching at Tap Academy is 
structured in a way that makes it easy for students from all domains to understand 
the concepts and technology taught by the trainers.
Finally, I got placed as a Software Engineer at Revature with a package of 3.25 LPA. 
The placement team helped me a lot in securing this job.Thank you to the entire Tap Academy team 
for helping me acquire this opportunity.

    <h3>Gagan GR</h3>
After joining Tap Academy, I have improved my programming skills, and my 
knowledge of core Java has also improved. Now, I am learning the Collection Framework, 
MySQL, HTML, and CSS in parallel.
Through the TAI platform, I have enhanced my problem-solving skills. Additionally, 
the LMS makes it easy to watch all the recorded videos. They also provide recorded 
videos of frameworks like J2EE, Spring, Data Structures, etc.
I got placed in Promantia Business Solutions for the role of Associate Technical Consultant 
with a package of 3 LPA.
Thank you TAP ACADEMY for giving me this opportunity.
