    <h1>3.What will you learn?</h1>
    <h3>Curriculum</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Core Java</li>
<pre>This course covers the theoretical foundations of Java, including its
history, key features, and object-oriented principles like 
encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. You will 
also learn about platform independence, JVM, memory management, data types, 
operators, exception handling, and multithreading, building a strong base for 
practical Java programming.</pre>
        <li>Programming</li>
<pre>This Java programming course enhances problem-solving and logical 
thinking skills through 500+ coding challenges. You'll develop the 
ability to tackle complex problems and refine your critical thinking,
laying a strong foundation for advanced software development.</pre>
        <li>MySQL</li>
<pre>The objective of the SQL course is to equip learners with a solid 
understanding of managing and manipulating relational databases 
using SQL. It focuses on performing key operations such as querying, 
updating, inserting, and deleting data, as well as managing database 
structures like tables, views, and indexes. The course aims to enable 
efficient and effective database interaction for data storage, retrieval, 
and management.
</pre>
        <li>HTML,CSS & JS</li>
<pre>By completing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript course, you'll gain a 
solid understanding of these foundational web technologies. You'll 
learn to create structured, visually appealing, and interactive web 
pages using HTML for content, CSS for styling, and basic JavaScript 
for functionality. This course will equip you with the skills to design 
responsive and accessible websites, providing a strong foundation for 
future web development projects.</pre>
        <li>Advanced Java</li>
<pre>Advance your Java skills by mastering JDBC for seamless database 
interaction, JEE for scalable enterprise applications, and JSP for 
dynamic web content generation. These core technologies enable developers 
to create robust, efficient Java-based solutions. JDBC 
allows easy data manipulation, JEE provides enterprise-level 
scalability, and JSP enhances user experiences with dynamic web 
pages. Together, they form the foundation of modern Java web 
development, unlocking endless possibilities for building 
sophisticated applications. Embrace Advanced Java to elevate your 
software development capabilities.</pre>
        <li>Frameworks</li>
<pre>In the Hibernate course, gain expertise in object-relational mapping 
(ORM) to streamline database interactions, manage object 
persistence, and enhance performance. Learn to integrate Hibernate 
into Java projects, enabling the creation of robust and maintainable 
database-driven applications.Master the Spring framework, a 
powerful tool for building scalable Java applications with features like 
dependency injection and aspect-oriented programming, simplifying 
development and maintenance.</pre>
        <li>DSA</li>
<pre>In the Data Structures and Algorithms course, you'll master key 
concepts and techniques essential for efficient problem-solving in 
Java. You'll gain hands-on experience with various data structures 
and algorithms, enabling you to design optimized solutions for 
complex problems. This course equips you with the skills to build 
scalable, high-performance software systems, preparing you to 
confidently handle diverse programming challenges.</pre>
